# Course title: Data Analysis with R for Social Scientists

Level: Bachelor
Structure: 90 min per week, 14 sessions
Language: Englisch

Objective: 
1.	After this course, students will be able to write a BA-thesis involving basic empirical data analysis. 
2.	Expertise to apply regression analysis to large-N data

Prüfungsnebenleistung:
5 page report (no theory, no lit review) 

Modulprüfung:
Seminarpaper (Rmarkdown ~12 pages; incl. mini lit review, theory, further analysis)

Format:
Focus is on applied data analysis, sessions will involve basic introduction to main concepts and sessions where students directly apply data analysis techniques using real social science data.

Dataset: 

In-class: WVS (https://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/WVSDocumentationWV7.jsp)

Excersises/Report: WVS, but allow other datasets if the student have specific thematic
interests and dataset is available(?)


## Implementation: 

Jakob:	4, 5, 7, 8 + maybe DAG (before 4)

Jasper: 2, 10, 12, (1 / 14 ?)

WHK: 3, 6, 9, 11 + Prep, review, and layout gitbook


## Syllabus - by week of instruction
1.	Intro to seminar
2.	Exploratory data anaylsis (EDA) - I (ggplot; gtsummary; x)
  *	load data
  *	introduce WVS
  *	glimpse()
  *	skim()
  *	types of variables/ skalen
•	univariate statistics (means, SDs, min, max)
•	histograms
•	boxplots
•	bar graphs
•	Scatterplots
•	Kreuztabellen
3.	EDA - II  -> in class exercise
•	Markdown
•	With own data: Students apply
4.	Linear Regression - theory
•	What is it?
•	When and for what can it be used?
• Formula (short)
•	Assumptions (short)
•	Interpretation of results?
•	Mediation (maybe theory into DAG session and example into application?)
•	Multiple outcomes
5.	Linear Regression – application
•	Incl. Short theory and DAG
•	application with WVS data
•	include: interpretation of regression table
• Mediation; total + direct effect
• maybe: regression diagnostics
6.	Linear Regression - exercise
•	In-class exercises with dataset we provide
7.	Logistic Regression - theory
•	What is it?
•	kurz: Annahmen
•	When and for what can it be use
•	Interpretation of results?
•	Mediation
•	Multiple outcomes 
8.	Logistic Regression - Application
•	application with WVS data
9.	Logistic Regression - Exercise
•	discussion of a-home exercises based on second dataset
10.	Prediction/ Margins – theory and application
•	predicted probabilities (at various covariate levels)
•	marginal effects
•	Outlook: 
11.	Prediction/ Margins – exercise 
•	predicted probabilities (at various covariate levels)
•	marginal effects
•	Outlook: 
12.	Reporting/ Visualization
•	formatted regression tables
•	Publication-ready formatting/ labelling of visuals
•	coefficient plots
13.	Discussion of ideas for term papers
14.	Outlook
•	Machine learning


Idea (Jakob): Maybe we can combine 13+14 (14 doesn't have to be that long?) and
make room for a DAG session before starting out with Linear Regression. I think
that if we do want to include DAGs (I want to), we should give the ideas some
space. Some DAG theory and examples and then we can start out with linear reg
and use DAGs throughout
