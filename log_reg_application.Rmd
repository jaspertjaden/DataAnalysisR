# Session 8: Logistic Regression - Application

# Example research question

* Short theory
  * DAG from this
    * What do we have to control for to identify effect of interest?

# Application with WVS data

## R Code

* glm()
  * family and link

## Interpretation of regression table in practice

* What are Logits?
* Maybe: Odds Ratios

# Regression Diagnostics (relatively short?)

# Mediation

* total + direct effect
  * use DAGs again
  * apply with glm()
  * Interpret results
* But maybe leave out completely (see session 7)

# Maybes

* Interactions
  * In practice if introduced the week before
  * Maybe also introduce and apply here
