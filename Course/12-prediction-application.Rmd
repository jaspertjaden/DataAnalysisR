# Prediction - Application {#pm-a}
Here goes some texts.


## Exercises

1. **Variable selection**: Use variable selection methods, such as stepwise selection or best subset selection, to identify a subset of predictor variables that provide the best fit for a multiple linear regression model. Compare the performance of different models and discuss their relative strengths and weaknesses.
2. **Interaction effects**: Include interaction terms in a multiple linear regression model to capture the effect of two or more predictor variables interacting with each other. Interpret the coefficients of the interaction terms and discuss their implications from a social science perspective.
3. **Polynomial regression**: Use polynomial regression to model non-linear relationships between predictor variables and the response variable. Fit a polynomial regression model, generate predictions, and assess the model's performance.
4. **Model comparison**: Use model comparison methods, such as adjusted R-squared or AIC, to compare the performance of different linear regression models. Select the best model based on these criteria and discuss its strengths and weaknesses.
5. **Tidy models**: Use the `broom` package to convert linear regression models into tidy data frames using functions such as `tidy()`, `glance()`, and `augment()`. Manipulate and visualize the tidy data frames to gain insights into the models and their performance.
6. **Prediction intervals**: Generate prediction intervals for new observations using a fitted linear regression model. Interpret the prediction intervals and discuss their usefulness for making predictions in a social science context.
