# Prediction - Exercise {#pm-a}

**Still WIP!**

- **Task 1:** How the number of rooms in a house affects its price, you also have to consider how the crime rate might be influencing this relationship. Estimate and report the average causal mediation effect (ACME), the average direct effect (ADE), the total effect, and the proportion mediated. Explain what these effects mean and how to interpret them.

- **Task 2:** Create or show a data frame with the coefficients, standard errors, p-values, and confidence intervals of a linear regression model that predicts the median value of a home (`MEDV`) based on the nitric oxides concentration (`NOX`) and the average number of rooms per dwelling (`RM`).

- **Task 3:** Create a data frame with the R-squared, adjusted R-squared, root mean squared error, and other summary statistics of the linear regression model from task 1. Explain the output.

- **Task 4:** Generate predicted values and prediction intervals for the median value of a home (`MEDV`) based on the linear regression model from task 1, and add them as new columns to the test data set. Create a train-test split of the data set with 70% of the data for training and 30% for testing.

- **Task 5:** Create a data frame with the observed and predicted values, residuals, and other diagnostic measures for the linear regression model from task 1. Create a plot of the predicted values versus the observed values, with prediction intervals as ribbons. Calculate the root mean squared error of the predictions on the test data set.
