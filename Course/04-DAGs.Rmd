# DAGs {#dags-1}

* Before Linear Regression
* 2 main reasons to model
  * understand causal effects -> DAGs
  * predict -> later


## Causality

* Correlation does not equal Causation
  * Examples
* Identification of (causal) effect(s) of interest

## DAGs

* Indirect causal effect/Overcontrol Bias/Pipe
* Confounders/Fork
* Colliders
* Each with individual examples
  * Maybe one big example

## Total/Direct effect

* Identification
