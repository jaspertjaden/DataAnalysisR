# Linear Regression - Theory {#lin-t}

## Introduction

### What is Linear Regression

### When and for what can it be used?

* Metric outcome variables
* Predictors can be metric or categorical

* Assumptions

## Formal

### Regression Formula

* Simple Linear Regression
  * show intercept + beta graphically
  * How to get the coefficients
    * super short: OLS (graphically not how to solve); maybe leave out
* Multiple Linear Regression
  * maybe also show graphically for 2 x (plane)


## Interpretation of results

* Show example from WVS data (without the R code)


## Maybes

*	Mediation
  * maybe theory into DAG session and example into application
* Interactions
  * maybe introduce here and apply next session
  * maybe push it all into next session
  * or leave out completely
*	Multiple outcomes
  * maybe leave out
