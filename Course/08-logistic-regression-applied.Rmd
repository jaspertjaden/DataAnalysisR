# Logistic Regression - Applied {#log-a}

## Example research question

* Short theory
  * DAG from this
    * What do we have to control for to identify effect of interest?

## Application with WVS data

## R Code

* glm()
  * family and link

## Interpretation of regression table in practice

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
* What are Logits?
=======
* What are Logistics?
>>>>>>> Stashed changes
* Maybe: Odds Ratios

## Regression Diagnostics (relatively short?)

## Mediation

* total + direct effect
  * use DAGs again
  * apply with glm()
  * Interpret results
* But maybe leave out completely (see session 7)

## Maybes

* Interactions
  * In practice if introduced the week before
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
  * Maybe also introduce and apply here
