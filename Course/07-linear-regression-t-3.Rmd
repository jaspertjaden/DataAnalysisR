# Linear Regression Theory III: Diagnostics {#log-t-3}

## Introduction

## What is Linear Regression

* Part of Generalized Linear Models

## When and for what can it be used?

* Categorical outcome variables
* Predictors can be metric or categorical

* Assumptions

## Formal

## Regression Formula

* Logistic Regression
  * show logistic function (shape)
  * Link function
  * show intercept + beta graphically
  * How to get the coefficients
    * super short: ML (graphically not how to solve); maybe leave out

## Interpretation of results

* Show example from WVS data (without the R code)

## Maybes

*	Mediation
  * maybe to hard to do correctly
  * khb package available?
* Interactions
  * similar problem to above
*	Multiple outcomes
  * maybe leave out
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
