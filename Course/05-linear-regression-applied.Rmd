# Linear Regression - Applied {#lin-a}

## Example research question

* Short theory
  * DAG from this
    * What do we have to control for to identify effect of interest?

## Application with WVS data

### R Code

* lm()
  * formula syntax

### Interpretation of regression table in practice

## Regression Diagnostics (relatively short?)

## Mediation

* total + direct effect
  * use DAGs again
  * apply with lm()
  * Interpret results

## Maybes

* Interactions
  * In practice if introduced the week before
  * Maybe also introduce and apply here

## Outlook

* Alternative Packages
* Packages that expand upon the ideas
