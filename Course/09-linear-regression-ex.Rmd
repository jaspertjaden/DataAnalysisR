# Linear Regression - Exercise {#lin-e}

## Linear Regression - Exercise

In this exercise, you will again use the Boston Housing data set to explore the
relationship between housing prices and various features of the houses and their
surroundings. 

For an overview on the data set see [session 3](#eda-2).

Prepare by creating a new R Markdown file. 
Write all solutions in this file using code chunks as well as text to structure
the file (headers) and answer the questions. Do not forget to save the file in
the format `your_name_exercise_2.Rmd`.
You will have to turn in this file to the lecturers through Moodle.
Write a first code chunk in which you load
all necessary packages and import the data. For a reminder see 
[tasks 1 & 2 from the first exercise](#eda-2).

-   **Task 1:** We start out by analysing at the relationship between the 
    distance to employement centers and the median price of houses. 
    To explore this relationship, fit a simple linear regression model with
    `medv` as the dependent variable and `dis` as the independent variable.
    Interpret the estimated coefficients and the R-squared value.


-   **Task 2:** Conduct regression diagnostics on the model from task 1.
    Identify any potential problems such as non-linearity, heteroscedasticity, 
    outliers, or multicollinearity; and suggest potential solutions. 


-   **Task 3:** We now explore which other variables may be relevant in
    estimating the effect from distance to employment centers on the price of a
    house.
    Examine the variables present in the data set. You can see them listed in
    the [first exercise](#eda-2).
    Which variables do you suspect to be relevant?
    Draw a directed acyclic graph (DAG) using `dagitty()` to represent the
    relationships among the variables you deem relevant.


-   **Task 4:** Use the DAG you constructed above to decide on further variables
    to include in the model. Briefly describe your decision.
    Now fit a multiple linear regression model based on this.
    Interpret the estimated coefficients and the R-squared value. What changed
    compared to the first model?


-   **Task 5:** Rerun the regression diagnostics for the second model. What
    changed? Have some problems been solved? Have new problems emerged?
    What steps could be undertaken to solve remaining problems?


-   **Bonus Task** Implement changes you suggested in task 5 and rerun the
    model as well as the diagnostics. Did it help?
