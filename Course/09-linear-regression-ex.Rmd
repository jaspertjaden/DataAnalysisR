## Application of Logistic Regression
With WVS/own data: Students apply linear regression:

**DRAFT**

1. Load the `mtcars` dataset in R and fit a simple linear regression model using `mpg` as the response variable and `wt` as the predictor variable. Summarize the model using the `summary()` function from the `tidyverse` package and interpret the results.

2. Using the same model from exercise 1, interpret the p-value of the predictor variable. What does it tell you about the relationship between `mpg` and `wt`?

3. Calculate a 95% confidence interval for the slope of the regression line from exercise 1. Interpret the results.

4. Add an additional predictor variable, `hp`, to the model from exercise 1. Summarize the new model and interpret the results.

5. Perform regression diagnostics on the model from exercise 4. Check for normality, constant variance, and independence of residuals.

6. Load the `iris` dataset in R and fit a simple linear regression model using `Sepal.Length` as the response variable and `Petal.Length` as the predictor variable. Summarize the model and interpret the results.

7. Using the same model from exercise 6, interpret the p-value of the predictor variable. What does it tell you about the relationship between `Sepal.Length` and `Petal.Length`?

8. Calculate a 95% confidence interval for the slope of the regression line from exercise 6. Interpret the results.

9. Add an additional predictor variable, `Sepal.Width`, to the model from exercise 6. Summarize the new model and interpret the results.

10. Perform regression diagnostics on the model from exercise 9. Check for normality, constant variance, and independence of residuals.
